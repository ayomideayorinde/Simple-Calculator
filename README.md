Personal Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator I created as part of my learning journey after starting the Meta Front-End Development course on Coursera.

Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. Bootstrap
3. JavaScript
  
Although it's a straightforward project, I'm excited to have taken this first step in my front-end development journey. This marks the beginning of what I hope will be a rewarding and fulfilling path in web development.
